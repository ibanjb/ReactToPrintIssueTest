# Issue #107
https://github.com/gregnb/react-to-print/issues/107 

Problem: The module tries to print a second blank page.


# Steps to reproduce the print problem

## Step 1
Install all the dependencies with 'yarn'

## Step 2
Starts the dev-server with 'yarn start'

## Step 3
By default, the server will opens the url  http://localhost:8000/dashboard/analysis.

* If don't, go there to load the test page

## Step 4
In the upper section will see a huge blue button with the text "Print test !!!", click on it to open the print dialog window.
